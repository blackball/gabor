A dense gabor feature implementation based on OpenCV
===

will work out another clean & efficient version soon.

Notes on new version Gabor based on FFTW3
=====
There're lots of 'wisdom' told when your kernel is 
small, you'd better not using a fft routine...but 
in my case, my target image was less than 100*100, 
and the kernels was fixed at 15*15, and I have 
4*8 == 32 kernels, in another words,I have to convolute 
32 times in one not that big image.The benifit using DFT 
is I could do a lot pre-computed work, and a rough esimation 
shows I could gain a two-grade times faster speed.

This is why I use DFT (FFTW3) to re-implement the dense gabor feature.

The efficient dense gabor feature was finished (just two files: gabor3.h, gabor3.h), 
and an easy start example was lying in example3.cpp.
